This program will run various random effects such as holding movement keys down randomly, while you are playing a game

### Effects
Random keyboard movements (randomly spams WASD)
Random mouse movements (moves the mouse cursor around randomly)
A few more planned :)

#### Stop key
If the program is running, and you want it to stop globally, you can push the F1 key, you can also pause with the F3 key

###### Completion
At the moment the program is not complete, however it is somewhat working
